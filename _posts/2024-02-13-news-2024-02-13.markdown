Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy, Google's new Gemini AI app raises privacy concerns, while Oklahoma schools grapple with AI's risks to data privacy. Meanwhile, corporate America's pivot to AI leads to bias amplification, as DTEX Systems' Ai³ aims to transform insider risk investigations while addressing AI bias. In healthcare, AI regulations are being assessed due to AI's inherent biases. On the other hand, AI in HR is navigating the legal landscape to ensure fairness in employee selection. Geeta Gurnani, IBM Technology CTO, emphasizes the importance of AI governance imperatives for responsible innovation, particularly in ensuring fairness and reducing bias. Lastly, NFU survey reveals the need for support in poultry production, highlighting the lack of fairness in the supply chain and the risk of avian influenza.
