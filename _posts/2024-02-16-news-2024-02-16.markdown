Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy, NIST seems to have released a set of Differential Privacy Guidelines, on the other hand Meta is gearing up for a bias audit. While Meta is doing this, a new startup is unleashing the power of blockchain in AI ethics. Meanwhile, the ICO has updated its guidance on artificial intelligence and data protection, and OpenAI has revealed 'Sora', an AI video model capable of realistic text-to-video prompts. On the fairness front, there's a new study on dataset bias in machine learning for medical imaging, and the field studying fairness in machine learning is still in development. Lastly, concerns about bias in AI models are being addressed, with experts testing for misinformation, hateful content, and bias. Stay tuned for more updates on AI, fairness, and privacy!
