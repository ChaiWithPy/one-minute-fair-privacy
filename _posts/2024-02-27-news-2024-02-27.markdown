Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy, where the corporate AI race is raising privacy and security risks, with concerns over data security and privacy. Meanwhile, Bharat is urged to regulate technology platforms to control anti-Bharat AI bias, as Google faces backlash and a $90 billion selloff due to apparent bias in its Gemini AI image generator. On the other hand, Microsoft pledges regulatory respect with 11 AI access principles, emphasizing fairness across the AI economy. Additionally, AI surpasses human benchmark in a global study on personality and behavior, showing potential for ethical and socially aligned decision-making. This comes as ABI launches a guide to help firms with AI, focusing on accountability, transparency, fairness, safety, contestability, and redress within the developing regulatory framework. Stay tuned for more updates on the evolving landscape of AI privacy, bias, and fairness.
