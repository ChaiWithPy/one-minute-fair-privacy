Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy, where Salesforce's Einstein Copilot brings AI to CRM, while GoDaddy uses AI tools creating a security risk. Chelsea's winning AI formula targets Gen Z, utilizing AI software for marketing. On the other hand, Meta's AI tool creates historically inaccurate images, highlighting bias and overcorrection in AI models. Google's AI tool, Gemini, faces criticism for bias against White people. Meanwhile, ensuring fairness in AI systems becomes paramount as they integrate into daily lives. Additionally, combatting bias in AI involves diversifying data for greater inclusivity, while platforms are asked to seek approval for deploying under-trial AI.
