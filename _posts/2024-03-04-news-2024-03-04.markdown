Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy, Singapore issues deterministic AI privacy guidelines, while concerns arise about AI regulation and existing privacy principles. In Africa, caution is advised against over-trusting AI due to inherent biases. In healthcare, AI's potential bias in treatment decisions is under scrutiny. On the other hand, efforts are being made to enhance fairness in medical AI diagnosis, with a focus on improving AI prediction models for better fairness. Meanwhile, the advertising industry is urged to leverage AI for business growth amidst increasing privacy concerns and regulatory changes. Stay tuned as the debate on fairness for artists continues, with concerns raised about AI-generated music that may not compensate musicians fairly.
