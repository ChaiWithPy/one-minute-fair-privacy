Welcome to One-Minute-AI-Fairness-And-Privacy! Microsoft's Copilot AI can now read your files directly, but it's not the privacy nightmare it sounds like. State privacy chiefs are closely watching AI as they bootstrap their practices inside government. Meanwhile, concerns about AI reinforcing bias and discrimination are rising, with Google addressing allegations of racial bias and historical errors in its AI tech. As we accelerate towards the age of AI, it's becoming increasingly evident that we must address risks around gender bias and inclusion. The growth of AI, quantum computing, and the Internet of Things has driven hyper growth, leading to a call for Wisconsinites to deserve data privacy. How will AI overcome systemic gender and racial biases common among humans? Stay tuned for more updates on AI, privacy, and bias!
