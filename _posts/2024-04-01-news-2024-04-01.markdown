US Congress bans governmental use of Microsoft AI Copilot over security concerns, while AI is filtering out women who have taken maternity leave in job searches. FairPlay partners with Oscilar to offer AI fairness tools to its customers, and South Korea contends with AI and electoral integrity by prohibiting AI-generated deepfake content in political campaigning. Meanwhile, AI is already proliferating within federal agencies, raising fresh worries about privacy and surveillance, and generative AI in marketing requires clear accountability and transparency to ensure privacy. Nigerian government is urged to embrace AI with robust data collection and analysis practices to ensure fairness and inclusivity, and AI may turn the economy into a disaster movie due to data-driven bias on steroids.
