AI companies are working on reducing bias in their models. The U.S. Department of Labor has joined the Department of Justice's Artificial Intelligence Fairness Pledge. Meanwhile, leveraging AI to combat vaccine hesitancy among minorities is gaining attention. Additionally, there are concerns about AI chatbots treating users differently based on their names. On the privacy front, there is a focus on transparency about AI's role and limitations in public health communication to mitigate fears of manipulation or privacy breaches. San Jose has initiated a pilot program harnessing AI to detect homeless encampments, emphasizing the need to prioritize privacy protection as AI technology becomes more prevalent. Lastly, a UN resolution co-sponsored by Kenya spells hope for Africa in addressing bias and discrimination in AI systems.
