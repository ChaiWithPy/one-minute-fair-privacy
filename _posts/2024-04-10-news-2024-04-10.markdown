AI is tackling privacy issues with Proton's acquisition of Standard Notes and the proposed American Privacy Rights Act. Meanwhile, bias in AI is under scrutiny with concerns about generative AI chatbots producing biased text and the impact of AI on the trans community. On the fairness front, Amazon is investing in a 10-year research collaboration to advance AI, and a new US bill may require developers to disclose their use of copyrighted music to train generative AI models. Additionally, generative models are being used to improve the fairness of medical classifiers under distribution shifts.
