UT Austin president aims to expand AI projects and research, while new AI road cameras in Stoke-on-Trent face privacy concerns. Tax audits with AI are touted to be unbiased, but Foodstuffs apologizes after AI misidentifies a Maori customer. AI's potential in planetary health is acknowledged, but challenges with data and algorithm bias persist. Federal ministers emphasize budget investments for fairness, as Kevin McCarthy's call for election fairness receives pushback. Meanwhile, a Finnish coffee roastery surprises with an AI-generated blend.
