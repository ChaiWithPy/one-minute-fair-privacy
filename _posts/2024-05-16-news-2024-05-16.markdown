Schumer's slow-walk on AI regulation is a boon for Big Tech, while a bipartisan group of senators unveils a $32 billion roadmap for regulating AI. On the other hand, a new AI program aims to break barriers for female students, and there's a report on navigating demographic measurement for fairness and equity in AI. Additionally, the UK is regulating AI in the education sector to ensure fairness, and a startup is racing ahead with privacy, cybersecurity, and AI heats for the life insurance industry.
