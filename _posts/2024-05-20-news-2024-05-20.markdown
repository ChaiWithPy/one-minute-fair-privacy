AI is increasingly being regulated for privacy and data protection. Ethical concerns are raised due to privacy breaches and perpetuating biases. Bias in AI systems can have significant consequences in the humanitarian sector. Malfunctioning AI systems could spread bias in areas like healthcare and job recruitment. AI is making significant strides in cancer treatment, but there are concerns about bias in AI models. The Japanese government is drafting basic AI regulation policies, considering legally requiring major AI developers to disclose certain information. The significant impact of AI on elections is evident in the electoral Supercycle year of 2024. A new book navigates the legal landscape of AI governance, providing a comparative panorama of global trends and legal approaches towards AI fairness.
