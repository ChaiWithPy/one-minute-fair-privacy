California Legislature returns with a push for AI regulation, while Europe's AI Act enters into force. Financial service providers in Germany receive guidance on AI, and Senator Ted Cruz aims to scale back AI regulation. Meanwhile, candidates and HR leaders increasingly accept AI in hiring, but concerns over fairness and bias in AI recruitment algorithms grow among HR professionals in Singapore. AI ethicists are working to ensure responsible development and deployment of AI systems, mitigating potential biases and ensuring fairness.
