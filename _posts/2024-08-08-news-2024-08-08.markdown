Amazon's $4 billion investment in AI firm Anthropic faces UK merger investigation, while Australia's Senate inquiry highlights the urgent need for responsible AI, focusing on data integrity and privacy. Ethical assurance ensures AI systems do not reinforce biases or inequalities, promoting fairness and justice. On the other hand, AI has trouble picturing physicians that aren't White men, highlighting the issue of biases in AI. Additionally, the University of Delaware uses AI to transform lectures into study tools, and a 14-year-old Haryana farmer's son claims six patents, AI bot, and robotic vision, emphasizing the importance of AI fairness. Furthermore, a survey reveals 84% of tech execs support AI copyright reform, highlighting the urgent need for updated regulations in data privacy and security.
