A new enterprise AI platform promises faster inference and lower costs for private cloud, addressing concerns about data privacy. Kamala Harris's potential presidency could mean increased AI regulation, while AWS is working on building a responsible AI ecosystem by rigorously testing for accuracy and fairness. On the other hand, there are growing concerns about biases in AI, with critics arguing that predictive policing may perpetuate historical biases. The White House is cooperating with the United Arab Emirates to address bias, discrimination, and ensure fairness in AI algorithms. Additionally, Scienaptic's AI-driven credit underwriting platform is live, focusing on fair and compliant AI. It's crucial to ensure transparency, accountability, and fairness in AI algorithms to prevent bias and discrimination.
