Trump aims to repeal Biden's controversial AI executive order, while LCO and Ontario Human Rights Commission collaborate on a Canadian human rights law-based AI impact assessment tool. Additionally, bills have been introduced in Congress to oversee agency use of AI and establish dedicated civil rights offices.

Trump's unpredictable AI policy plans, influenced by advisors like Elon Musk, add further complexity to the landscape.
