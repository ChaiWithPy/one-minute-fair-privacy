AI technologies are transforming sectors, raising concerns about data privacy. Hospitals are prioritizing AI in the C-Suite to mitigate biases in AI systems affecting patient care. Algorithmic bias in AI systems can perpetuate biases in training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Meanwhile, there are growing concerns about the fairness of AI in auto insurance rates. Amidst these challenges, new AI-powered solutions like Adjusto aim to ensure fairness and trust in claims experience. As the AI race intensifies, there is a call to give America the energy to win while ensuring a fair competition.
