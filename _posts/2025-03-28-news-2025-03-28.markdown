AI is making tax scams harder to spot, while agencies are preparing for rising AI costs. Discrimination is now an optional risk to assess in AI, and GPT-4o's "freedom" is overshadowed by concerns of AI-driven censorship. Redefining hiring with AI recruitment involves testing for bias, and Anthropic aims to make AI models safe by mitigating bias. The debate on AI ownership and authorship continues, and a watchdog is tracking AI firms' safety pledges. SMEs are focusing on ethics, fairness, and privacy in AI solutions for manufacturing.
