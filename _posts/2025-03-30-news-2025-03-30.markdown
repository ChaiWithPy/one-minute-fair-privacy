India is developing AI-specific regulations to address privacy and bias concerns. Meanwhile, AI models are being traumatized to study their biases. Financial services in the US are transforming with AI, but facing challenges of algorithmic bias. The Korean Fair Trade Commission is using AI tools to create webtoons for public outreach, promoting fairness. Additionally, concerns are raised over the fairness of AI-generated orders by the tax department.
