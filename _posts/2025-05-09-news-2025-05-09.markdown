AI is reshaping workplaces, but concerns about privacy and discrimination persist. Organizations are focusing on HIPAA compliance for AI in digital health, while the UN calls for gender bias avoidance in AI. The role of Chief AI Officer is emerging to manage risks like data privacy and model bias. In healthcare, AI's impact on bias and equity for Black patients is under discussion. Additionally, there is a growing emphasis on fairness, accountability, transparency, and ethics in AI, with a structured approach to ethics in AI projects. IAB Australia has launched an AI Working Group to provide practical industry guidance on AI use, bias, and fairness.
