Meta's AI chatbot defaults to public interactions, raising privacy concerns. AI tools and social media platforms are also collecting and storing user data. Meanwhile, there's a growing focus on AI bias mitigation, with experts highlighting inherent human biases in AI models. Additionally, ethical biases in publicly available datasets are being uncovered, emphasizing the need for fairness in AI applications. This comes as there's a call for integrating fairness and inclusion into AI design and governance, and the use of AI in online casinos raises questions about tracking and predicting user behavior.
