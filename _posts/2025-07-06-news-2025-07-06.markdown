AI tools are raising concerns about data privacy, while educators are navigating the use of AI in classrooms with special privacy protections. Racist stereotypes are shaping AI, leading to biased outcomes, and India's digital divide is causing welfare bias. On the other hand, AI training has been approved as fair use in groundbreaking court decisions, and there are calls to fix AI's data theft problem with onchain attribution for fairness. Additionally, there's a growing debate over the misuse of celebrity identity and AI, highlighting the need for privacy protection.
