China releases AI action plan days after the U.S. as global tech race heats up, while the U.S. is focusing on reducing alleged "woke" bias in AI models. Meanwhile, a new study emphasizes the need to correct biases in hydro climatic interactions for realistic river discharge prediction. On the other hand, opinions are split on students using AI for coursework, with concerns raised about fairness and the need for a strategy to address AI misuse. Additionally, the integration of AI in the classroom is highlighted, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding privacy, safety, and learning. These developments underscore the growing emphasis on addressing bias and fairness issues in AI, as well as the need for responsible innovation in the global tech landscape.
